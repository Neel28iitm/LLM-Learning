It is one of the eight public Institutes of Eminence of India. As an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), IIT Madras is also recognised as an Institute of National Importance.[5]\\n\\nFounded in 1959 with technical, academic and financial assistance from the then government of West Germany, IITM was the third Indian Institute of Technology established by the Government of India.[6][7] IIT Madras has consistently ranked as the best engineering institute in India by the Ministry of Education's National Institutional Ranking Framework since the ranking's inception in 2016.[8][9][10]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Indian Institutes of Technology\\nIn 1956, the West German Government rendered technical assistance to establish a state of the art engineering institute in India. Soon, the first Indo-German agreement was signed in Bonn, West Germany in 1959 for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras (now Chennai). IIT Madras was started with technical, academic and financial assistance from the Government of West Germany and was at the time the largest international educational project sponsored by the West German government. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to provide the following assistance in the establishment of a higher technological institute at Madras:\\n\\nA workshop, laboratory equipment, and a library whose total value does not exceed ₹1.8 crore (equivalent to ₹166 crores or $20 million in 2024) .[11]\\nTwenty German professors to serve at the institute for a period of four to five years\\nFour German foremen for the workshops of the institute for two years\\nFacilities for the training of twenty Indian teachers in German institutions[12]\\nThis has led to several collaborative research efforts with universities and institutions in Germany over the years.[13] Although official support from the German government has ended, several research efforts involving the DAAD programme and Humboldt Fellowships still exist.\\n\\nThe Indian Institute of Technology, Madras started functioning with the first batch of 120 students being admitted in July 1959 to the first year of the Engineering Course.[14] The institute was inaugurated in 1959, by the then Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs. The first batch had an overall strength of 120 students from across India.[15] In 1961, the IITs were declared to be Institutes of National Importance. The first convocation ceremony was held on 11 July 1964, with Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, then the president of India, delivering the convocation address and awarding the degrees to the inaugural batch of students.[16] The institute got its first women students in the BTech batch of 1966.[17] IIT Madras celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2009, and its Diamond Jubilee in 2019.[18]\")]"

Often the words stress andstrain are used synonymously by the nonscientiﬁc\\npublic. In engineering usage, however, stress is the intensity of force and strain is a\\nmeasure of the amount of deformation.\\n1.1 STRESS\\nStress σis deﬁned as the intensity of force at a point.\\nσ=∂F/∂Aas∂A→0, (1.1)\\nwhere Fis the force acting on a plane of area, A.\\nIf the stress is the same everywhere in a body,\\nσ=F/A. (1.2)\\nThere are nine components of stress as shown in Figure 1.1 . A normal stress component\\nis one in which the force is acting normal to the plane. It may be tensile or compressive.\\nA shear stress component is one in which the force acts parallel to the plane.\\nStress components are deﬁned with two subscripts. The ﬁrst denotes the normal\\nto the plane on which the force acts and the second is the direction of the force.∗For\\nexample, σxxis a tensile stress in the x-direction. A shear stress acting on the x-plane\\nin the y-direction is denoted by σxy.\\nRepeated subscripts (e.g., σxx,σyy,σzz) indicate normal stresses. They are tensile\\nif both the plane and direction are positive or both are negative. If one is positive and\\nthe other is negative they are compressive. Mixed subscripts (e.g., σzx,σxy,σyz) denote\\nshear stresses. A state of stress in tensor notation is expressed as\\nσij=⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐σxxσyxσzx\\nσxyσyyσzx\\nσxzσyzσzz⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐, (1.3)\\n∗The use of the opposite convention should cause no problem because σij=σji.\\n1'),\n",

External forces on a portion\\nof a body are balanced by internal forces acting on the arbitrary cut through the body.\\nAs an example, ﬁnd the stresses in the walls of thin wall tube under internal pressure\\n(Figure 1.11 ). Let the tube length be L, its diameter Dand its wall thickness tand let the\\npressure be P(Figure 1.11a ). The axial stress, σy, can be found from a force balance\\non a cross section of the tube. Since in PπD2/4=πDtσy,\\nσy=PD/(4t). (1.42)\\nThe hoop stress, σx, can be found from a force balance on a longitudinal section\\nof the tube ( Figure 1.11b ).PDL =2σxtLor\\nσx=1\\n2PD/tσy=PD/(2t). (1.43)\\nA moment balance can be made about any axis through a material. The internal\\nmoment must balance the external moment. Consider a cylindrical rod under torsion.\\nA moment balance relates the torque, T, to the distribution of shear stress, τxy(Fig-\\nure 1.12 ). Consider an annular element of thickness d rat a distance rfrom the axis. The\\nshear force on this element is the shear stress times the area of the element, (2 πr)τxydr.\\nThe moment caused by this element is the shear force times the distance, r, from the\\naxis so d T=(2πr)τxy(r)drso\\nT=2π∫R\\n0τxyr2dr.

Moment balance on an annular element.\\nAn explicit solution requires knowledge of how τxyvaries with rfor inte-\\ngration.\\n1.11 BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\\nIn analyzing metal forming problems, it is important to be able to recognize boundary\\nconditions. Often these are not stated explicitly. Some of these are listed below:\\n1. A stress, σz, normal to a free surface and the two shear stresses in the surface are\\nzero.\\n2. Likewise there are no shear stresses in surfaces that are assumed to be frictionless.\\n3. Constraints from neighboring regions: The strains in a region are often controlled\\nby the deformation in a neighboring region. Consider a long narrow groove in a\\nplate ( Figure 1.13 .) The strain εx, in the groove must be the same as the strain in\\nthe region outside the groove. However, the strains εyandεzneed not be the same.\\n4. Saint-Venant’ s principle states that the constraint from discontinuity will disappear\\nwithin one characteristic distance of the discontinuity. For example, the shoulder\\non a tensile bar tends to suppress the contraction of the adjacent region of the\\ngauge section. However this effect is very small at a distance equal to the diameter\\naway from the shoulder. Figure 1.14 illustrates this on sheet specimen.\\nBending of a sheet ( Figure 1.15 ) illustrates another example of Saint-Venant’ s principle.\\nThe plane-strain condition εy=0 prevails over most of the material because the bottom\\nand top surfaces are so close. However, the edges are not in plane strain because σy=\\n0. However, there is appreciable deviation from plane strain only in a region within a\\ndistance equal to the sheet thickness from the edge.\\nEXAMPLE 1.9: A metal sheet, 1 m wide, 3 m long and 1 mm thick is bent as shown\\ninFigure 1.15 .

Mohr (1835–1918) worked as a civil engineer designing bridges. At 32, he was\\nappointed a professor of engineering mechanics at Stuttgart Polytecknium. Among\\nother contributions, he also devised the graphical method of analyzing the stress at a\\npoint.\\nHe then extended Coulomb’ s idea that failure is caused by shear stresses into a\\nfailure criterion based on maximum shear stress, or diameter of the largest circle. He\\nproposed the different failure stresses in tension, shear, and compression could be\\ncombined into a single diagram, in which the tangents form an envelope of safe stress\\ncombinations.\\nThis is essentially the Tresca yield criterion. It may be noted that early workers used\\nthe term “failure criteria,” which failed to distinguish between fracture and yielding.\\nIn 1868, Tresca presented two notes to the French Academy ( Comptes Rendus\\nAcad. Sci. Paris , 1864, p. 754). From these, Saint-Venant established the ﬁrst theory\\nof plasticity based on the assumptions that\\n1) plastic deformation does not change the volume of a material,\\n2) directions of principal stresses and principal strains coincide,\\n3) the maximum shear stress at a point is a constant.\\nThe Tresca criterion is also called the Guest or the “ maximum shear stress ”\\ncriterion.\\nIn letters to William Thompson, John Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) proposed that\\n“strain energy of distortion” was critical, but he never published this idea and it was\\nforgotten. M. T. Huber, in 1904, ﬁrst formulated the expression for “distortional strain\\nenergy,”\\nU=[1/(12G)][( σ2−σ3)2+(σ3−σ1)2+(σ1−σ2)2]w h e r eU =σ2\\nyp/(6G).\\nThe same idea was independently developed by von Mises ( G¨ottinger. Nachr .\\nMath. Phys. , 1913, p. 582) for whom the criterion is generally called. It is also referred\\nto by the names of several people who independently proposed it: Huber, Hencky, as\\nwell as Maxwell. It is also known as the “maximum distortional energy” theory and\\nthe “octahedral shear stress” theory. The ﬁrst name reﬂects that the elastic energy in\\nan isotropic material, associated with shear (in contrast to dilatation) is proportional to\\n(σ2−σ3)2+(σ3−σ1)2+(σ1−σ2)2. The second name reﬂects that the shear terms,\\n(σ2−σ3), (σ3−σ1), and ( σ1−σ2), can be represented as the edges of an octahedron\\nin principal stress space.'),\n",

Reconsider the case of the thin-wall tube under internal pressure.\\nAlthough the maximum pressure occurs when ¯ ε=(2/3)n, strain localization cannot\\noccur, because localization would cause a decrease of the local radius of curvature,\\nwhich would decrease the stress in that area below that of the rest of the sphere. Instead\\nthe sphere will continue to expand uniformly. The walls are in biaxial tension so the\\nmaximum wall force will occur when ¯ ε=2n. Strain localization still cannot occur\\nbecause any localization would decrease the radius of curvature. Figure 4.9 shows\\nthese points.\\nAny strain localization under biaxial tension must occur because of local inhomo-\\ngeneity. The role of inhomogeneity is developed in Chapter 15.'),\n",

One school∗†maintains that deformation occurs primarily by\\ndiffusional creep with vacancies migrating from grain boundaries normal to the tensile\\naxis to those parallel to it (i.e., diffusion of atoms from boundaries parallel to the ten-\\nsile axis to boundaries perpendicular to it).

If diffusion were the only mechanism, m\\nwould equal one (Newtonian viscosity) but it is lowered because of the slip contribution\\nto the overall strain. The other school‡attributes the high rate sensitivity to the role\\nof grain-boundary sliding (shearing on grain boundaries).

In the absence of applied stress, the activation\\nbarrier has a height Qand the rate of overcoming this barrier would be proportional to\\nexp(−Q/RT). However, unless the position at the right is more stable, i.e., has a lower\\nenergy than the position on the left, the rate of overcoming the barrier from right to left\\nwould be exactly equal to that in overcoming it from left to right, so there would be no\\nnet dislocation movement. With an applied stress, σ, the energy on the left is raised by\\nσV, where Vis a constant with dimensions of volume, and on the right the energy is\\nlowered by σV. Thus the rate from left to right is proportional to exp[ −(Q−σV)/RT]\\nand from right to left the rate is proportional to exp[ −(Q+σV)/RT].

Hot working is often deﬁned as\\nworking above the recrystallization temperature so that the work metal recrystallizes\\nas it deforms. However, this is an oversimpliﬁed view.

Poor surface ﬁnish and loss of precise gauge control result from the lack of adequate\\nlubrication, oxide scales, and roughened tools.\\n5. The lack of work hardening is undesirable where the strength level of a cold-worked\\nproduct is needed.\\nBecause of these limitations, it is common to hot roll steel to a thickness of about\\n0.10 inches to take advantage of the decreased ﬂow stress at high temperature. The\\nhot-rolled product is then pickled to remove scale, and further rolling is done cold to\\nensure good surface ﬁnish and optimum mechanical properties.

If one region or band deforms more than another, the greater heating may lower\\nthe ﬂow stress in this region, causing even more concentration of ﬂow and more local\\nheating in this region. An example of this is shown in Figure 5.27 , where in the up-\\nsetting of a steel bolt head, localized ﬂow along narrow bands raised the temperature\\nsufﬁciently to cause the bands to transform to austenite. After the deformation, these\\nbands were quenched to martensite by the surrounding material. Similar localized\\nheating, reported in punching holes in armor plate, can lead to sudden drops in the\\npunching force. Such extreme localization is encouraged by conditions of high ﬂow\\nstresses and strains which increases /Delta1T, low rates of work hardening and work-piece\\ntool geometry that encourages deformation along certain discrete planes.\\nNOTES OF INTEREST\\nSvante August Arrhenius (1859–1927) was a Swedish physical chemist. He studied at\\nUppsala where he obtained his doctorate in 1884. It is noteworthy that his thesis on\\nelectrolytes was given a fourth (lowest) level pass because his committee was skeptical\\nof its validity. From 1886 to 1890 he worked with several noted scientists in Germany\\nwho did appreciate his work. In 1887, he suggested that a very wide range of rate\\nprocesses follow what is now known as the Arrhenius equation. For years his work was\\nrecognized throughout the world, except in his native Sweden.\\nCount Rumford (Benjamin Thompson) was the ﬁrst person to measure the mechan-\\nical equivalent of heat. He was born in Woburn, Massachusetts in 1753, and studied at\\nHarvard. At the outbreak of the American Revolution, after being denied a commis-\\nsion by Washington, he was commissioned by the British. When the British evacuated\\nBoston in 1776, he left for England, where he made a number of experiments on heat.\\nAfter being suspected of selling British naval secrets to the French, he went to Bavaria.\\nIn the Bavarian army he eventually became Minister of War and eventually Prime\\nMinister. While inspecting a canon factory, he observed a large increase in temperature\\nduring the machining of bronze canons. He measured the temperature rise and with\\nthe known heat capacity of the bronze, he calculated the heat generated by machining.\\nBy equating this to the mechanical work done in machining, he was able to deduce the\\nmechanical equivalent of heat.'),\n",

In this case it will have been strain hardened at least as\\nmuch as if it had been drawn.\\n6.5 EFFECTS OF DIE ANGLE AND REDUCTION\\nFigure 6.5 shows schematically the dependence of the friction and redundant work\\nterms on die angle. For a given reduction, the contact area between the die and material\\ndecreases with increasing die angle. The pressure the die exerts on the material in the\\ndie gap is almost independent of the die angle, so the force between the die and work-\\npiece increases with greater area of contact at die angles. With a constant coefﬁcient\\nof friction, wf, increases as αdecreases. The redundant work term, wf, increases with\\ndie angle. The ideal work term, wi, doesn’t depend on the die angle. For each reduction,\\nthere is an optimum die angle, α∗, for which the work is a minimum.\\nThe efﬁciency and optimum die angle are functions of the reduction. In general,\\nthe efﬁciency increases with reduction. Figures 6.6 and 6.7are adapted from the\\nmeasurements of Wistreich.∗The optimum die angle increases with reduction.\\n∗J. Wistreich, Metals Rev.

Dry sand piled on a ﬂat surface\\nwill form a hill with a constant slope. This slope is analogous to the linear increase of\\nPwith distance from the edge of the work piece. The effect of sticking friction can be\\nanalyzed using this effect. Sand can be piled onto cardboard or other ﬂat material cut\\nto the shape of the work piece. The volume of sand, found by pouring into a calibrated\\nvessel or by weighing, is proportional to the integral of ( P–Y ) over the compressed\\nsurface, and thus to the total compressive force minus Ytimes the area. This method\\ncan be used to analyze complex shapes.\\n7.9 FLAT ROLLING\\nFlat rolling of plates and sheets is essentially a plane-strain compression because the\\nlength of contact between rolls and work piece, L, is usually much smaller than the\\nwidth of the sheet, w,(Figure 7.8 ). As the plastic region is thinned by the compressive\\nstress, σz, it is free to expand in the rolling direction, x. However lateral expansion in\\nthey-direction is constrained by the undeforming material on both sides of the roll gap.\\nThe net effect is a condition of plane strain, εy=0 andεz=−εx, except at the edges.\\nOn the inlet side of the gap, the roll surface is moving faster than the work material,\\nwhereas on the outlet side material moves faster than the roll surface ( Figure 7.9 ).

Measurements of local pressure made\\nby embedding pressure-sensitive pins into the compression platens indicate sticking at\\nthe edges and sliding in the center. Figure 8.5 shows that Pdoes increase with distance\\nfrom the edge, but the slope, d P/dxdecreases as sliding friction would predict or even\\nremains constant as sticking friction would predict.\\nThe explanation for this is that, early in the compression, lubricant at the edges\\nruns out and the edge of the work piece makes contact with the platen and sticks to it.\\nLubricant is trapped in the central region so that the frictional shear forces are lower\\nFigure 8.5.

The heat generated at the mating surfaces causes bonding\\nof material to the tools. Galling is progressive, the rate of material transferred to the\\ntools accelerating as forming progresses. Eventually the friction becomes so high that\\nthe process must be terminated and the tools cleaned. Galling often occurs during\\nthe forming of aluminum and causes tool breakdown. The tendency to gall can be\\ndecreased by the use of lubricants. The galling onto coated steel tools during forming\\ndepends on the work material. For stainless steel, carbon-based coatings provide the\\nbest protection, whereas aluminum and titanium alloys require nitride-type coatings,\\nsuch as TiN. TiC and CrN are also useful.\\n8.5 ULTRASONICS\\nIt has been suggested that ultrasonic vibrations applied during forming can reduce\\nfrictional forces.\\nNOTE OF INTEREST\\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) proposed that the frictional force on a body is propor-\\ntional to the load and that it is independent of the area of contact.

Exact solutions must be both statically andkinematically admissible.\\nThat means they must be geometrically self-consistent as well as satisfying required\\nstress equilibrium everywhere in the deforming body. Frequently it is simpler to use\\nlimit theorems that allow one to make analyses that result in calculated forces that are\\nknown to be either correct or too high or too low than the exact solution.\\nLower bounds are based on satisfying stress equilibrium, while ignoring geometric\\nself-consistency. They give forces that are known to be either too low or correct. As\\nsuch they can assure that a structure is “safe.” Conditions in which η=0 are lower\\nbounds. Upper-bound analyses on the other hand predict stress or forces that are known\\nto be too large. These are usually more important in metal forming. Upper bounds are\\nbased on satisfying yield criteria and geometric self-consistency. No attention is paid\\nto satisfying equilibrium.\\n9.1 UPPER BOUNDS\\nThe upper-bound theorem states that any estimate of the forces to deform a body made\\nby equating the rate of internal energy dissipation to the external forces will equal or\\nbe greater than the correct force. The analysis involves:\\n1. Assuming an internal ﬂow ﬁeld that will produce the shape change.\\n2. Calculating the rate at which energy is consumed by this ﬂow ﬁeld.\\n3. Calculating the external force by equating the rate of external work with the rate\\nof internal energy consumption.\\nThe ﬂow ﬁeld can be checked for consistency with a velocity vector diagram or\\nhodograph . In the analysis, the following simplifying assumptions are usually made:\\n1. The material is homogeneous and isotropic.\\n2. There is no strain hardening.\\n3. Interfaces are either frictionless or sticking friction prevails.\\n4. Usually only two-dimensional (plane-strain) cases are considered with deformation\\noccurring by shear on a few discrete planes. Everywhere else the material is rigid.\\n113'),\n",

Slip lines∗are planes of maximum shear\\nstress and are therefore oriented at 45◦to the axes of principal stress. Basic assumptions\\nare:\\n1. The material is isotropic and homogeneous.\\n2. The material is rigid-ideally plastic (i.e. no strain hardening).\\n3. Effects of temperature and strain rate are ignored.\\n4. Plane-strain deformation.\\n5. The shear stresses at interfaces are constant, usually frictionless or sticking friction.\\nFigure 10.1 shows the very simple slip line for indentation where the thickness, t,\\nequals the width of the indenter, b. The maximum shear stress occurs on line DEB and\\nCEA. The material in triangles DAE and CEB is rigid. As the indenters move closer\\ntogether the ﬁeld must change. However, for now, we are concerned with calculating\\nthe force when the geometry is as shown. The stress, σy, must be zero because there\\nis no restrain to lateral movement. The stress, σz, must be intermediate between σx\\nandσy.Figure 10.2 shows the Mohr’ s circle for this condition. The compressive stress\\nnecessary for this indentation, σx=–2k. Few slip-line ﬁelds are composed of only\\nstraight lines. More complicated ﬁelds will be considered.\\n10.2 GOVERNING STRESS EQUATIONS\\nWith plane-strain, all of the ﬂow is in the x–yplane. This means that d εy=−dεx\\nand dεz=0s oσz=σ2=(σx+σy)/2. Therefore according to the von Mises crite-\\nrion,σzis always the mean or hydrostatic stress.\\nσ2=(σ1+σ2+σ3)/3=σmean (10.1)\\n∗The term slip lines used here should not be confused with the microscopic slip lines found on\\nthe surface of crystals.\\n132'),\n",

B.\\nMellor, Engineering Plasticity , 1973.\\n10.11 CONSTANT SHEAR STRESS INTERFACES\\nSlip-line ﬁelds can be used to solve problems with sticking friction or a constant friction\\ninterface. One example is the compression between rough platens. This approximates\\nconditions during hot forging. With sticking friction the slip lines are parallel and\\nperpendicular to the platens. There is a dead-metal zone where they do not meet the\\nplatens. Figure 10.26 shows the appropriate slip-line ﬁeld. The appropriate boundary\\ncondition is σx=σ1=0 along the left-hand side of the ﬁeld. Values of P⊥=−σx\\nalong the centerline can be found by rotating on α- andβ-lines. Then P⊥avecan be\\nfound by numerical integration. How much of this ﬁeld should be used depends on\\nH/L. Results of calculations for various values of H/Lare shown in Figure 10.27 . The\\nslab solution of P⊥/2k=1+(1/4)H/Lis shown for comparison.\\nIf there is shear stress at the tool interface, τ=mk, theα- andβ-lines meet the\\ninterface at an angle, θ=(1/2)arc cos mandθ′=90-θ. A general Mohr’ s stress circle\\nplot for this condition is shown in Figure 10.28 .'),\n",

With indirect extrusion there are no chamber walls. As the ram\\napproaches the die, there may be a drop caused by a change of direction of material\\nﬂow. See Figure 10.30.

Factors that increase the strength generally decrease ductility.\\nSolid solution strengthening, precipitation, cold work and decreased temperatures all\\nlower fracture strains. The reason is that with higher strengths, the stresses necessary\\nfor fracture will be encountered sooner.\\nInclusions play a dominant role in ductile fracture. The volume fraction, nature,\\nshape, and distribution of inclusions are important. In Figure 12.2 , the tensile ductility\\nis seen to decrease with increased amounts of artiﬁcial inclusions. Despite the scatter, it\\nappears that some second-phase particles are more deleterious than others.

If the movement of the\\nneutral axis is neglected, the tensile strain on the outside of the bend is e=h/(2r) and\\nfailure occurs when this strain reaches a critical value. For brittle materials, this strain\\nis approximately the percent elongation in a tension test. For ductile materials necking\\noccurs at a strain a little greater than the uniform elongation in a tension test because\\nof support from elements nearer the neutral plane. This support varies with the section\\nshape, which can be characterized by h/t, where tis the thickness of the section. In\\nslender sections ( h/tis large) there is less support to the outer sections than if h/tis\\nsmall. Therefore the critical value of h/rdecreases with h/t.\\nThe tendency to buckling on the inside of the bend depends primarily on h/t,b u t\\nit also increases with bend severity.

In low production items, this tendency\\ncan be lessened by ﬁlling the tube with sand or a low melting point metal. In high\\nproduction items, a ball or plug mandrel can be used to preserve the cross section.\\nThis internal support will however lower the forming limits by causing greater tensile\\nstrains in the outside ﬁbers.

Recrystalliza-\\ntion during annealing usually changes the crystallographic texture but doesn’t cause\\nrandomness. (Repeated heating and cooling through the α→γ→αtransformation\\nmay be a possible exception.) How crystallographic textures develop and how texture\\ninﬂuences the anisotropy are not treated in this text. The anisotropy of textured titanium\\nsheet will be considered, however, because of the insight it gives to the subject.\\nAlpha-titanium alloys have a hexagonal-close packed crystal structure. Deforma-\\ntion occurs primarily by slip in close-packed <11¯20>directions, which lie in the basal\\nplane parallel to the edges of the hexagonal cell as shown in Figure 14.1 . Whether\\nslip occurs on the (0001) basal planes or on the {10¯10}prism planes, there is no strain\\nparallel to the c-axis because the slip direction is normal to the c-axis. Not even slip on\\nthe{10¯11}pyramidal planes will cause c-axis strain.\\nRolled sheets of α-titanium alloys develop strong textures that may be most simply\\ndescribed in terms of an ideal texture with the c-axis of most grains aligned with the\\nnormal to the rolling plane. There is some spread from this ideal orientation, particularly\\nwith a rocking of the c-axis±up to 40◦from the sheet normal toward the transverse\\ndirection.\\nWhen a tensile specimen cut from a sheet is extended, slip can easily occur on the\\n{10¯10}prism planes. Even though the yield strength may be almost unchanged with the\\norientation of the tensile specimen relative to the rolling direction, the material is not\\nisotropic. Slip on the {10¯10}prism planes causes contraction in the plane of the sheet,\\nbut no thinning. A useful parameter to describe this sort of anisotropy is the ratio, R,\\nof the plastic strain in the width direction to that in the thickness direction,\\nR=εw\\nεt(14.1)\\n∗In contrast, anisotropy of fracture behavior is largely governed by mechanical alignment of\\ninclusions, voids and grain boundaries.\\n212'),\n",

In sheet forming, tension\\npredominates whereas bulk forming operations are predominately compressive. In\\nsheet forming operations at least one of the surfaces is free from contact with the tools.\\nUseful formability is normally limited by localized necking, rather than by fracture as\\nin bulk forming. There are instances of failure by fracture but these are unusual.\\nSheet forming processes may be roughly classiﬁed by the state of stress. At one\\nend of the spectrum is the deep drawing of ﬂat-bottom cups. In this case, one of the\\nprincipal stresses in the ﬂange is tensile and the other is compressive. There is little\\nthinning but wrinkling is of concern. At the other end of the spectrum are processes,\\nusually called stamping, in which both of the principal stresses are tensile so thinning\\nmust occur. Rarely does the formability in sheet forming processes correlate well with\\nthe tensile ductility (either reduction in area or elongation at fracture).\\n15.1 CUP DRAWING\\nThe deep drawing of ﬂat-bottom cups is a relatively simple process. It is used to\\nproduce such items as cartridge cases, zinc dry cells, ﬂashlights, aluminum and steel\\ncans, and steel pressure vessels. The process is illustrated by Figure 15.1 . There are\\ntwo important regions: the ﬂange where most of the deformation occurs and the wall,\\nwhich must support the force necessary to cause the deformation in the ﬂange. If the\\nblank diameter is too large, the force in the wall may exceed its strength, thereby\\ncausing failure. Forming limits are described by a limiting drawing ratio ( LDR ), which\\nis the largest ratio of d 0/d1that may be successfully drawn. In this respect deep\\ndrawing is similar to wire drawing. Indirect compression is induced by tensile forces\\nin the drawn material. Each wedge-shaped element in the ﬂange must undergo enough\\ncircumferential compression to permit it to ﬂow over the die lip. A typical drawing\\nfailure is shown in Figure 15.2 . The ﬂanges must be held down to prevent wrinkling.\\nFigure 15.3 shows what happens when the hold-down force is insufﬁcient.\\nThe following analysis, based on the work of Whiteley∗uses the coordinate system\\nillustrated in Figure 15.4 .

One\\nis at the die lip. Here the normal force is N≈πFd/2, so the frictional contribution to\\nthe drawing force should be approximately equal to πμFd/2 (see Problem 15.5).

It has been suggested that the hold-down\\nforce be a constant fraction of the tensile strength, which is almost equivalent. Thus\\nthe efﬁciency should not vary signiﬁcantly with material properties.\\nSeveral investigators have considered another possible mode of failure in materials\\nof low n-value. They predict failure in the region between the die lip and punch early\\nin the punch stroke before any wall has formed. Such failures would occur so early in\\nthe punch stroke that there would be little expenditure of energy against friction and\\nbending so the efﬁciency at that point would be much higher than later in the stroke.\\nTherefore these analyses, which are based on 100% efﬁciency, fail to account for the\\nfact that the drawing force would be higher at a later stage.\\n15.5 EFFECTS OF TOOLING ON CUP DRAWING\\nDrawability depends on tooling and lubrication as well as on material properties. The\\nwork expended in bending and unbending as the material ﬂows over the die lip increases\\nwith the ratio of the sheet thickness to the radius of the die lip. This causes a higher'),\n",

However, if the die-lip radius is too large, wrinkling\\nmay occur in the unsupported region between the die and punch.\\nThe radius of the punch nose is also important. When failures occur they are\\nusually near the bottom of the wall where the material hasn’t been work hardened. With\\na generous punch radius, the failure site is moved upward on the wall where the wall\\nhas been strengthened by more work hardening.\\nLubrication has two opposing effects. Lubrication of the ﬂange and die lip reduces\\nthe frictional work. However, high friction between the cup wall and the punch causes\\nshear stresses to move the potential failure site upward into material that has been\\nwork hardened more. Abrasion to roughen the punch has been known to increase\\ndrawability. However, it is difﬁcult to maintain such roughness in production. A similar\\nincrease of drawability has been achieved by drawing into a chamber of pressurized\\nwater.∗The pressure increases the friction between the punch and the wall. Increased\\ndrawability can also be achieved by maintaining the punch temperature lower than the\\nﬂange temperature.†The temperature difference keeps the ﬂange softer than the wall.\\nIdeally the hold-down force should be adjusted to a level just sufﬁcient to prevent\\nwrinkling. Swift‡has recommended a hold-down pressure of1/2to 1% of the yield\\nstrength but the optimum pressure decreases with increasing sheet thickness. Above\\nt/d=0.025, no hold-down is necessary.§\\n15.6 EARING\\nThe height of the walls of drawn cups usually have peaks and valleys as shown in\\nFigure 15.12 . This phenomenon is known as earing . There may be two, four or six\\nears, but four ears are most common. Earing results from planar anisotropy and ear\\nheight and angular position correlate well with the angular variation of R. For two or\\nfour ears, earing is described by the parameter\\n/Delta1R=R0+R90−2R45\\n2. (15.12)\\nIf/Delta1R>1, there are ears at 0◦and 90◦and if /Delta1R<1, ears form at 45◦. This variation\\nis shown in Figure 15.13 . Earing is undesirable because the walls must be trimmed\\ncreating scrap. With earing, the full beneﬁt of a high RonLDR is not realized.\\nExperimental correlations of earing with /Delta1Rare shown in Figure 15.14 .\\nThe angular dependence of earing can be estimated by assuming that the state of\\nstress at the outer edge of the blank is uniaxial compression and that the compressive\\nstrain is the same everywhere along the top of the ﬁnal cup. The thickness strain then is\\n∗W . G. Granzow, Paper No. F-1920. Fabricating Machinery Assn . Rockford IL, 1975.\\n†W. G. Granzow, Sheet Metal Industries , v. 55 (1979).\\n‡Chung and Swift, Proc.

For a non-strain-hardening material the punch forces during redrawing are constant\\nexcept at the very start and end (a). The redraw force for a strain-hardening material increases during\\nthe stroke because the initial drawing hardens the material at the top of the walls (b).\\nthan the bottom, the redrawing force rises during the punch stroke. Furthermore, with a\\nwork-hardening material, the top of the wall will have been strengthened more during\\nthe initial draw so the punch force in redrawing must rise with stroke as the harder\\nmaterial is being deformed. This is shown schematically in Figure 15.16 . The bottom\\nof the cup wall, which must carry the redrawing force, is not strengthened during the\\ninitial draw. The limiting redraw ratio is greater for materials with low n-values (as\\ncold-rolled sheets) than for those with high n-values (annealed sheets). High R-values\\nare beneﬁcial because the ﬂow during the reduction of wall diameter and the potential\\nnecking failure of the wall are the same as in the initial cupping.\\n15.8 IRONING\\nIroning is the forced reduction of wall thickness, which increases the wall height. Some\\nironing of the top of the wall may occur during the initial drawing. In this case the\\nironing adds to the total punch force as shown in Figure 15.17 . Because the ironing\\noccurs late in the draw, it may not affect the drawability.\\nIroning is often used as a separate process after drawing and redrawing. In the\\nmanufacture of aluminum beverage cans, ironing is used to increase the wall height by\\na factor of three. Of course, there is a limiting reduction that can be made in a single\\nironing pass because high reductions may cause the wall strength to be exceeded. As\\nwith redrawing, the limiting reduction decreases with work-hardening capacity (higher\\nn-values) because the bottom of the wall is not strengthened as much in the initial\\ndrawing. Heavily work-hardened sheets perform better than annealed ones. This is\\nshown in Figure 15.18 . Redrawing, unlike cupping and redrawing, the R-values have\\nno effect on ironability because both the forced deformation and the failure mode\\ninvolve the same plane-strain.\\nIroning tends to greatly reduce the earing. This is because the valleys are thicker\\nthan the ears so are elongated more.'),\n",

They replaced\\nthe earlier steel cans made from three separate pieces: a bottom, the wall, which was\\nbent into a cylinder and welded, and a top. Today the typical beverage can is made\\nfrom a circular blank, 5.5 inches in. diameter, by drawing it into a 3.5 inch diameter\\ncup, redrawing to 2.625 in. diameter, and then ironing the walls to achieve the desired\\nheight.

This is enough for every\\nman, woman, and child to consume one beer or soft drink every day.\\nCartridge brass (Cu-35 Zn) is susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking in atmo-\\nspheres containing ammonia.

The principal strains can be\\nfound by measuring the major and minor diameters after straining. By convention, the\\nengineering strains e1ande2are reported. These values at the neck or fracture give\\nthe failure condition, while the strains away from the failure indicate safeconditions as\\nshown in Figure 16.6 . A plot of these measured strains for a material form its forming\\nlimit diagram (FLD), also called a Keeler-Goodwin diagram, because of early work\\nby S. P . Keeler∗and G. Goodwin.†Figure 16.7 shows a typical FLD for a low-carbon\\nsteel.\\nA plot of the combination of strains that lead to failure is called a forming limit\\ndiagram or FLD. Figure 16.7 is such a plot for a low-carbon steel. Combinations of ε1\\nandε2below the curve are safe and those above the curve lead to failure. Note that the\\nlowest value of ε1corresponds to plane-strain, ε1=0.\\nFigure 16.8 is a comparison of this FLD with equations 16.10 and 16.11 for local\\nand diffuse necking. For negative values of e2the experimental and theoretical curves\\nare parallel.

In some cases there\\nis a die, which reverses the movement of material after it is stretched over the punch.\\n17.2 DRAW BEADS\\nDraw beads ( Figure 17.2 ) are used to create tension in the sheet being formed by pre-\\nventing excessive drawing. As a sheet moves through a die bead it is bent three times\\nand unbent three times. Each bend and each unbend there requires plastic work. Over\\neach radius there is friction. Bending and unbending create resistance to movement of\\nthe sheet. If the resistance is sufﬁciently high, the sheet will be locked by the draw bead.\\nThe restraining force of the draw bead can be controlled by the height of the insert.\\nThe restraining force has two components. One is caused by the work necessary\\nto bend and unbend the sheet as it ﬂows over the die bead and the other is the work\\nto overcome friction.

Figure 17.7 shows\\nthe region of wrinkling on a forming limit diagram.\\nWrinkling is a potential problem in drawing of many parts. Consider the forming of\\na ﬂat-bottom cup with conical walls as shown in Figure 17.8 . As the punch descends,\\nthe shaded element is drawn closer to the punch so its circumference must shrink.\\nStretching of the wall in tension will reduce the circumference, but if the wall isn’t\\nstretched enough it will wrinkle. The amount of stretching can be increased by raising\\nthe blank-holder pressure. However, too much restraint of ﬂange drawing in by excessive\\nblank-holder pressure or draw beads may cause the wall to fail in tension. Therefore\\nthe blank-holder pressure must be controlled.∗\\nThere is a window of permissible levels of blank-holder force. Too little causes\\nwrinkling; too much force results in wall failure. This is shown in Figure 17.9 . Since\\nmore circumferential contraction occurs when material with high R-values is stretched,\\nthere is more contraction in the plane of the sheet so an increased Rwidens the left\\nside of the window. With an increased value of n, more stretching can occur before\\nfailure. For any given material and required depth of draw, there is a window of\\npermissible blank-holder force.

The relative magnitudes of F1andF2, can be calculated approximately as\\nfollows: a radial force balance on an element in the bend gives the normal force, d N=\\nFdθ, so the frictional force on the element is μdN=μFdθ, where μis the coefﬁcient of\\nfriction.

Otherwise, the panel\\nmay not retain the desired shape or it may feel ﬂoppy to the customer. A target strain\\nat the center of the panel will also ensure enough work hardening to strengthen the\\npanel. To achieve this target strain, there must be sufﬁcient tension in the sheet at that\\npoint. Because of friction and bending, the tension at the binder must be much higher.\\nFigure 17.13 illustrates a part being stamped. The ﬁnal part is actually from A to C. The\\nmaterial between C and the edge of the binder must be stretched in the die to achieve\\nthe required stress at point A, but is later trimmed off and discarded. The example\\nbelow is in plane-strain but real parts are usually stretched in the normal direction as\\nwell. The highest stress will occur in the stretch wall between C and D. To determine\\nwhether this stamping can be made, it is necessary to ﬁx the strain level required at A\\nand then calculate the stress in this region to determine whether it exceeds the tensile\\nstrength of the material.\\n∗This section is a result of private discussions with Edmund Herman, Creative Concepts Company.'),\n",

The major concerns in shearing are the\\nnature of the sheared edge, tool wear, and tool forces. The shape of the sheared edge,\\nshown in Figure 19.11 , depends on the clearance and the sharpness of the tools. The\\nheights of burrs are usually less than 10% of the sheet thickness. For low-carbon steels,\\nclearance between punch and die is usually 5 to 12% of the thickness. Tight clearances\\nresult in cleaner holes but with lower tool life.\\nFormability during subsequent hole expansion or ﬂanging depends on the nature of\\nthe ﬂanged edges. The presence of burrs decreases forming limits (see Section 19.6).\\nThe sharpness of the tools decreases with life as wear occurs. The wear rate is greater\\nin higher strength sheets.\\nThe forces required for shearing depend on the angle of the shearing edge to\\nthe sheet. If the cutting edge is parallel to the sheet, all of the shearing will occur\\nsimultaneously. By increasing the angle, the amount of material being sheared at\\nany instant decreases. The shearing force is increased with smaller clearances, duller\\ntools, and higher strength sheets. The force also varies during the stroke. Initially the\\nshearing occurs through the entire thickness. As the tool penetrates, the area being\\nsheared decreases.\\nburnish\\nburrburr hei ghtfractureroll over\\nFigure 19.11.

In this case, whole clusters of grains have two different orientations.\\nThese clusters are elongated in the direction of prior working.

Both of which impart very small strains (typically <0.5%) to the sheet.\\nIn roller leveling the sheet is bent back and forth by a series of small diameter rolls\\nas shown in Figure 21.6 . This causes local regions to yield without much change in\\nthickness. Roller leveling is often used to remove the yield point in low-carbon steels,\\nas well as to straighten steel plates or strip after ﬁnal rolling, heat treatment, or cooling\\noperations.\\nTemper rolling (also called pinch passing or skin rolling) is also used to remove\\nthe yield point in steels. The reduction is very light (typically1/2%). This is effective\\neven though not all of the material deforms, as shown in Figure 21.7 .\\nFigure 21.6. Schematic of roller leveling.\\nFigure 21.7.

IF steels typically have very low strengths. The advantage of these\\nsteels is that they are very formable. Control of crystallographic texture is also fun-\\ndamental in producing exceptional deep drawability. Typically ¯R=2.0. ( R-values of\\ntraditional aluminum killed steels rarely exceed 1.8). Formability is also enhanced by\\nhigh n-values ( ≈2.5).\\nFine grain sizes and higher strengths can be achieved by alloying with Nb. High-\\nstrength IF steels are solution-hardened with small amounts of Mn, Si, and P . The\\ntensile strength is increased 4 MPa by 0.1% Mn, 10 MPa by 0.1%Si and 100 MPa\\nby 0.1%P in solution. The presence of titanium reduces the phosphorus in solution by\\nforming FeTiP . The increased strength comes at the expense of a somewhat reduced\\nformability.

This causes a violent rimming action as the\\nCO bubbles are emitted, causing tiny drops of iron to burn in the air. Aluminum is\\nadded in the ladle to react with oxygen removing it in the form of Al 2O3, which rises to\\nthe surface and is scraped off. This “kills” the rimming action. Aluminum also ties up\\ndissolved nitrogen as AlN. Because of the removal of nitrogen, strain aging only occurs\\nat elevated temperatures. Typically an aluminum-killed steel will have an n-value of\\nabout 0.22 and an R-value of 1.8.\\nBake-hardenable steels : Steels having enough carbon and/or nitrogen in solution\\nto strain-age at the temperatures for paint baking are termed bake-hardenable. The\\nlow-yield strength without a yield point prior to forming and the high strength caused\\nby strain-aging are useful for producing dent resistance or down-sizing the thickness\\nfor weight reduction. Bake-hardenable steels are used in hoods, quarterdeck panels,\\nroofs, doors, and fenders. With a low-carbon level they have good weldability.\\nHSLA steels (high-strength low-alloy): HSLA steels are much stronger than plain-\\ncarbon steels. They are used in cars, trucks, cranes, bridges, and other structures where\\nstresses may be high. A typical HSLA steel may contain 0.15% C, 1.65% Mn and\\nlow levels (under 0.035%) of P and S. They may also contain small amounts of Cu,\\nNi, Nb, N, V , Cr, Mo, and Si. The term “micro-alloying” is often used because of\\nsmall amounts of alloying elements. As little as 0.10% niobium and vanadium can\\nhave profound effects on the mechanical properties of a 0.1% C, 1.3% Mn steel. The\\nMn provides a good deal of solid solution strengthening. The other elements form a\\nﬁne dispersion of precipitated carbides in an almost pure ferrite matrix. Rapid cooling\\nproduces a ﬁne grain size which also contributes to the strength. Yield strengths are\\ntypically between 250 and 590 MPa (35,000 to 85,000 psi). The ductility and n-values\\nare lower than in plain-carbon steels.

An alloy with small amounts of Cu,\\ncalled Cor-ten, forms a rust that is quite adherent and is used architecturally.\\nDual-phase (DP) steels : These have been heat-treated to obtain 5 to 15% martensite\\nin a ferrite matrix. They replace many HSLA grades. Uses include front and rear rails,\\nbumpers, and panels designed for energy absorption.\\nTRIP steels (transformation-induced plasticity): The microstructure of TRIP steels\\nconsists mainly of ferrite but there is also martensite, bainite, and retained austenite.\\nThe various levels of these phases give TRIP steels their unique balance of properties.\\nDuring forming, the retained austenite transforms to martensite. This results in\\na high rate of work hardening that persists to higher strains, in contrast to that of\\nDP which decreases at high strains. This causes enhanced formability. The carbon\\ncontent controls the strain level of retained austenite-to-martensite transformation.\\nWith low-carbon levels, transformation starts at the beginning of forming, leading\\nto excellent formability and strain distribution at the strength levels produced. With\\nhigh-carbon levels, retained austenite is more stable and persists into the ﬁnal part.\\nThe transformation occurs at strain levels beyond those produced during stamping and\\nforming. Transformation to martensite occurs during subsequent deformation, such as\\na crash event, and provides greater crash energy absorption. Spot welding of TRIP\\nsteels is made more difﬁcult by the alloying elements.\\nComplex-phase (CP) steels : These have a very ﬁne microstructure of ferrite with\\nmartensite and bainite. They are further strengthened by precipitation of niobium,\\ntitanium, or vanadium carbonitrides. They are used for bumpers and B-pillar reinforce-\\nments because of their ability to absorb energy.\\nMartensitic grades : The microstructures of martensitic grades are completely\\nmartensite. Tensile strengths vary between 900 and 1,500 MPa (130 and 220 ksi).\\nThese grades can be made directly at the steel mill by quenching after annealing or\\nby heat treating after forming. Mill-produced material has a very low ductility so it is\\ntypically roll-formed.\\nThe carbon content controls the strength level. The tensile strength in MPa is\\napproximately\\nTS=900+2800×%C. (21.2)\\nManganese, silicon, chromium, molybdenum, boron, vanadium, and nickel are\\nused in various combinations to increase hardenability.

The formability problem is aggravated by the lowering of the forming limit curves\\nby the thinner gauges (Figure 16.18). There is much current research aiming to increase\\nthe ductility of higher strength steels. One approach is to incorporate more austenite\\ninto the microstructures. Increased austenite levels together with more martensite and\\nstill ﬁner grain sizes also raise the strength level.\\nConsiderable heating can occur during the high strain rates of forming of high-\\nstrength steels. Typical strain rates in automotive stampings are 10/s so little heat is\\ntransferred from the deforming steel. According to equation 5.24, with a ﬂow stress\\nof 720 MPa and a strain of 0.50, the expected temperature rise is about 100◦C.

However, lubrication is more difﬁcult.\\n21.12 COPPER AND BRASS\\nBoth annealed copper and brass work harden rapidly. The zinc addition in brass\\nincreases the yield and tensile strengths as shown in Figure 21.20 . The strain-hardening\\nexponent (0.35 to 0.5 for copper and 0.45 to 0.6 for cartridge brass) increases with zinc\\ncontent, and larger grain sizes. However the larger grain size causes the orange peel\\neffect. The strain-rate sensitivities for copper alloys are low ( ≤0.005) and the R-values\\nare less than unity (typically 0.6 to 0.9). Annealing at a very high temperature after\\na very heavy cold reduction produced a cube texture in which <100>directions are\\naligned with the rolling, transverse and thickness directions. The resulting sheet has a\\nlowRavand/Delta1R.\\nBrasses containing 15% or more zinc under stress are susceptible to stress-\\ncorrosion cracking in atmospheres containing ammonia. Tensile stresses across grain\\nboundaries cause them to crack as shown in Figure 21.21 . The susceptibility increases\\nwith zinc content. Unless the parts are stressed in service, the problem can be alleviated\\nby stress-relief anneals. Brasses should be annealed between 200◦and 300◦C. Higher\\nannealing temperatures are recommended for silicon bronze, aluminum bronze, and\\ncupronickel.\\n0                           10                        20                         30400\\n200\\n0Tensile and yield stren gths, MPa\\n% ZincTS\\nYScopper\\ncommercialbronze\\nred brass\\nlow brass\\ncartrid ge\\nbrassgilding\\nmetal\\nFigure 21.20.

From Metals Handbook ,8 t he d .v .7\\nASM 1972.\\n21.13 HEXAGONAL CLOSE-PACKED METALS\\nThe crystallographic textures of hcp metal sheets tend to have the basal (0001) planes\\naligned with the plane of the sheet. With most, deformation is mainly by <11¯20>slip,\\nso high R-values are common.\\nIn the past, there was very little forming of magnesium sheets because of limited\\nductility. Recently, however, there is an increased interest in magnesium because its\\nlow density can lead to weight saving. Magnesium sheets have strong crystallographic\\ntextures with the basal plane aligned with the plane of the sheet. As a result of this\\ntexture and easy {10¯12}<¯1011>twinning in tension this results in higher in-plane\\nyield strengths in tension than in compression as indicated by Figure 21.22 .\\nBasal slip and twinning are the primary deformation mechanisms. Above about\\n225◦C, other slip modes can be activated. To have the necessary ductility, forming\\nof magnesium alloy sheets is generally done at 200◦C or higher. The most common\\nsheet alloy, AZ31B contains about 3% Al and 1% Zn. Rolled sheets have shear bands\\ninclined at about 60◦to the sheet normal. These persist even after annealing at 350◦C.\\nRolled sheets of an alloy AE21 (about 2% Al and 1% rare earths) have similar shear\\nbands but these disappear after annealing at 350◦C. Rolled ZEK100 (about 1% Zn, and\\nless than 0.5% rare earths and zirconium) can be deep drawn at about 150◦C.\\nIt has been known for years that repeated roller leveling of AZ31B-O modiﬁes its\\ncrystallographic texture and allows bends of 2 to 3 times sheet thickness instead of the\\nusual 5.5 times sheet thickness. Recently it has been shown that a very ﬁne grain size\\ncan be produced by severe deformation. This decreases the anisotropy and decreases\\nthe tendency for twinning so forming can be done at much lower temperatures.∗\\n∗Q. Y ang and A. K.

In all cases it is\\ncommon to ion-nitride or chrome plate the die faces. Initial tryout dies may be made\\nfrom a zinc alloy.\\nFlanging and trimming dies are made from tool steels.\\n21.15 PRODUCT UNIFORMITY\\nVariations of sheet thickness and properties are undesirable. Subtle changes can cause\\nfailures with tooling that has been adjusted to give good parts with a particular batch of\\nsteel. Problems may arise from differences from one coil of steel to another or differ-\\nences between different mills. There may be nothing inherently bad about the steel that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'metal.pdf', 'page': 337}, page_content='324 SHEET METAL PROPERTIES\\nperforms poorly. There are often differences between the edges and center of a coil. Such\\nproperty differences may be caused by variations of grain size, texture, or composition.\\nDuring casting impurities segregate toward the center. When the cast slab is rolled,\\nthese may cause weakness at the centerline. Curved molds are frequently used in\\ncontinuous casting. Because the last material to freeze in such molds is displaced\\nsomewhat from the centerline, failures may be caused by segregated inclusions not on\\nthe exact centerline.\\n21.16 SCRAP\\nThere are two sources of scrap. New scrap is the offal of manufacturing processes\\nresulting from trimming and occasional bad parts. Since the composition of new is\\nwell-known it can be re-melted to make more of the same alloy. Other scrap ( old\\nscrap) comes from cans, engine blocks, cylinder heads, buildings, and other sources.\\nIts composition is less well-known.\\nA large fraction (42%) of steel is from recycling. Steel and iron can easily be\\nseparated magnetically from other scrap. The scrap is either re-melted in an electric\\narc furnace or added to pig iron in a basic oxygen furnace. All grades of steel can\\nbe recycled because most alloying elements are oxidized during processing. Tin and\\ncopper are the exceptions and there is concern in the steel industry about the gradual\\nbuild up of these tramp elements in steel.\\nThe distinction between new and old scrap is particularly important with aluminum\\nalloys. Alloying elements cannot be removed from aluminum alloys during melting so\\nold scrap must be used to produce alloys with less critical compositions. Aluminum\\nscrap is shredded and any lacquer is removed from cans before re-melting. Re-melting\\naluminum requires only 5% of the energy to produce virgin aluminum from bauxite\\nand emits only 5% of the CO2. The energy saving is 14kwh/kg.\\nNOTES OF INTEREST\\nIn 1886, both Charles M. Hall in the United States and Paul-Louis-Toussaint H ´eroult\\nin France independently developed an economical process for producing aluminum.\\nBefore this, aluminum was more expensive than platinum, and for that reason was\\nchosen to cap the Washington Monument. Both men were only 22. Hall was a recent\\nchemistry graduate of Oberlin College, and H ´erault had studied at the School of Mines\\nin Paris. Within two years, aluminum production was in full swing in Europe and the\\nUnited States. The American spelling (with “um” instead of the “ium” common to\\nmetals) comes from an advertisement of the Pittsburg Reduction Company. Whether\\nthe omission was intended or a mistake is unknown.\\nIn the early 1850’ s, Henry Bessemer in England and William Kelley in the United\\nStates developed a scheme for making cheap steel. Both realized that the carbon content\\nof pig iron could be reduced from about 4% to a low level by blowing air through it.\\nKelly’ s family and friends thought he was insane, but he perfected his process by 1851.\\nSix years later, Bessemer received a U.S. patent for essentially the same process. Their\\nsteel replaced wrought iron as the strongest material. Although their process was later'),\n",
